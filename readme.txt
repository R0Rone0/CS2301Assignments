ctest.c:
	Many different actions are tested in ctest.c. Most of these functions
	have been user defined in mystring.c. Refer to mystring.c and
	mystring.h for the complete list of functions used in ctest.c.
	ctest.c also tests the functionality of structs in C, by creating
	a struct for an Employee, and having the user define one Employee,
	and a random generator create a second employee.

mystring.c:
	Holds many of the functions used in ctest.c. These functions are
	user created functions of standard library C functions. These
	functions include:
		mystrdup
		mystrlen
		mystrcpy
		mystrcat
		mystrncpy
		mystrncat
		mystrndup
		rand_char_array
		rand_char
	These functions operate as their C library counterpart do, without
	referencing these pre-defined functions. For more information on
	these functions, refer to the Doxygen website provided below.
